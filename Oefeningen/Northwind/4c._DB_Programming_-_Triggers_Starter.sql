/*
A trigger: a database program, consisting of procedural and declarative instructons, 
saved in the catalogue and activated by the DBMS if a certain operation on the database 
is executed and if a certain condition is satisfied.

Comparable to SP but can't be called explicitly.
A trigger is automatically called by the DBMS with some DML, DDL, LOGON-LOGOFF commands
- DML trigger: with an insert, update or delete for a table or view  (in this course we further elaborate this type of cursors)
- DDL trigger: executed with a create, alter or drop of a table
- LOGON-LOGOFF trigger: executed when a user logs in or out (MS SQL Server: only LOGON triggers, Oracle: both)


DML triggers
- Can be executed with
	* insert
	* update
	* delete
- Are activated
	* before – before the IUD is processed (not supported by SQL Server)
	* instead of  –  instead of IUD command
	* after – after the IUID is processed (but before COMMIT), this is the default

Why using triggers?
- Validation of data and complex constraints
		* An employee can't be assigned to > 10 projects
		* An employee can only be assigned to a project that is assigned to his department
- Automatic generation of values
		* If an employee is assigned to a project the default value for the monthly bonus is set according to the project priority and his job category
- Support for alerts
		* Send automatic e-mail if an employee is removed from a project
- Auditing
	* Keep track of who did what on a certain table
- Replication and controlled update of redundant data
	* If an ordersdetail record changes, update the orderamount in the orders table
	* Automatic update of datawarehouse tables for reporting (see "Datawarehousing")

Advantages
- Major advantage
	* Store functionality in the DB and execute consistently with each change of data in the DB
- Consequences
	* no redundant code --> functionality is localised in a single spot, not scattered over different applications (desktop, web, mobile), written by different authors
	* written and tested 'once' by an experienced DBA
	* security --> triggers are in the DB so all security rules apply
	* more processing power --> for DBMS and DB
	* fits into client-server model --> 1 call to db-serve: al lot can be executed without further communication

Disadvantages
- Complexity
	* DB design, implementation are more complex by shifting functionality from application to DB
	* Very difficult to debug
- Hidden functionality
	* The user can be confronted with unexpected side effects from the trigger, possibly unwanted
	* Triggers can cascade, which is not always easy to predict when designing the trigger
- Performance
	* At each database change the triggers have to be reevaluated
- Portability
	* Restricted to the chosen database dialect (ex. Transact-SQL from MS)


Virtual tables with triggers --> zie slides
- deleted tablecontains copies of updated and deleted rows
	* During update or delete rows are moved from the triggering table to the deleted table
	* Those two table have no rows in common

- inserted tablecontains copies of updated or inserted rows
	* During update or insert each affected row is copied from the triggering table to the inserted table
	* All rows from the inserted table are also in the triggering table

/**** Remarks  **/
/****************/

/*
In addition to differences in syntax, the SQL products also differ in the functionality of triggers. 
Some interesting questions are:
- Can multiple triggers be defined for a single table and a specific transaction? 
  Sequence problems that can affect the result
- Can processing a statement belonging to a trigger action trigger another trigger?
  One mutation in an application can lead to a waterfall of mutations, recursion
- When exactly is a trigger action processed? 
  Immediately after the change or before the commit statement
- Can triggers be defined on catalog tables?

-- Exercise 1
-- Create a trigger that, when adding a new employee, sets the reportsTo attribute 
-- to the employee to whom the least number of employees already report.





-- Testcode
BEGIN TRANSACTION
INSERT INTO Employees(LastName,FirstName)

-- Exercise 2
/* 
Create a new table called ProductsAudit with the following columns:
AuditID --> Primary Key + Identity
UserName --> NVARCHAR(128) + Default value = SystemUser
CreatedAt --> DateTime + Default value = UTC Time
Operation --> NVARCHAR(10): The name of the operation we performed on a row (Updated, Created, Deleted)

If the table is already present, drop it.
Create a trigger for all actions (Update, Delete, Insert) to persist the mutation of the Products table.
Use system functions to populate the UserName and CreatedAt.
